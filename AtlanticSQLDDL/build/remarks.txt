This is a SQL DDL (Data Manipulation Language) zoo. It was generated from the KM3 zoo.

A set of .sql files were chosen randomly and were tested using MySQL 
as relational database (http://www.easyphp.org/).

Remarks:
The sql_mode variable was set to ANSI to support SQL keywords using double quotes. 
(set sql_mode = 'ANSI'). Additional info in http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-sql-mode.html.

The TCS file contains a subset of SQL keywords.
