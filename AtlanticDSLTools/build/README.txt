To build atlanticDSLTools you need:
- to put ant-contrib.jar from http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/ in the build folder.
  Only version 1.0b2 has been tested to work,
- to checkout org.eclipse.am3.zoos.atlantic in the same workspace,
- to have ADT + AM3 installed (including AM3 ant tasks for ADT)
