The Atlantic Microsoft DSL Tools Zoo

The Atlantic Microsoft DSL Tools Zoo is a mirror of the Atlantic Zoo. The metamodels expressed in KM3 format have been converted into "domain models" for DSL Tools. The generated files are expressed in the DSL Tools specific XML format (with a ".dsldm" extension).

Technical remarks:

    * We have chosen randomly a large set of generated "domain models" that have been tested under "Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition" with the "Visual Studio 2005 SDK - March 2006 CTP for v2" (link: http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/extend/) including the DSL Tools.
    * The current version does not manage multiple inheritance, multiple packages structuring and cycling dependences (KM3 support them whereas DSL Tools does not).
    * In the generated "domain models", the Xml Root concept may be easily changed manually, if necessary, by a right-click ("Make Xml Root") on the appropriated concept.
