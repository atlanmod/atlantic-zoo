# Atlantic Zoo

This project is a backup of the Atlanmod Zoo project as previously hosted in the Inria GForge - https://web.imt-atlantique.fr/x-info/atlanmod/index.php?title=Zoos

The provided metamodel zoos are the result of a collaborative open source research effort intended to produce experimental material that may be used by all in the domain of Model Driven Engineering.

Disclaimer: The metamodels made available in this project were built by different types of participants (experience engineers/researchers but also students) in different contexts (funded collaborative projects but also internships), thus we cannot provide any guarantee on their actual quality and current relevance (e.g. some related technologies may be outdated).
