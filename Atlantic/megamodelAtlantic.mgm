The Java specifications are community-maintained through the Sun-managed Java Community Process. Sun holds a trademark on the Java name. The Java software plays three crucial roles or identities in the field of software: as a programming language, as middleware, as a platform. A crucial component of Java is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The availability of the JVM on almost all types of device, chips and software package enables Java to function both as middleware and a computing platform. The JVM enables Java to be "platform independent" since the JVM on each device/chip interprets the standard Java bytecode. This means you can develop code on your PC and expect it to run on Java-enabled phones as well as on mainframes equipped with Java without any adjustments.

Professor Niklaus Wirth developed Pascal to provide features that were lacking in other languages of the time. His principle objectives for Pascal were for the language to be efficient to implement and run, allow for the development of well structured and well organized programs, and to serve as a vehicle for the teaching of the important concepts of computer programming. Pascal, which was named after the mathematician Blaise Pascal, is a direct descendent from ALGOL 60, which Wirth helped develop. Pascal also draws programming components from ALGOL 68 and ALGOL-W. The original published definition for the Pascal language appeared in 1971 with latter revisions published in 1973. It was designed to teach programming techniques and topics to college students and was the language of choice to do so from the late 1960's to the late 1980's. Significant Language Features: Built in Data Types- Pascal contains it's own built in data types of Integer, Real, Character, and Boolean. User defined Data Types - Has the ability to define scalar types as well as sub-ranges of those data types. Provides a defined set of Data Structures- These data structures include Arrays, Records, Files and Sets. Has a strong data typing element - Pascal compliers can diagnose an incompatible assignment of one type to a variable to another type. Supports Structured Programming - This is accomplished through the use of subprograms called procedures and functions. Simplicity and Expressivity - Because the language is simple and expressive in nature it allows for effective teaching of computer programming techniques.  The Prime area of application that Pascal entails is the learning environment. This language was not really developed to be used for anything other than teaching students the basics of programming, after all it was originally developed for this purpose. In the early 1970's to the early 1990 s Pascal was the language of choice for most major colleges and universities for teaching college level programming techniques.', '', workspace}

WSDL (Web Services Description Language) is an XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints operating on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. The operations and messages are described abstractly, and then bound to a concrete network protocol and message format to define an endpoint. Related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints (services). WSDL is extensible to allow description of endpoints and their messages regardless of what message formats or network protocols are used to communicate. WSDL service definitions provide documentation for distributed systems and serve as a recipe for automating the details involved in applications communication.  A WSDL document defines services as collections of network endpoints, or ports. In WSDL, the abstract definition of endpoints and messages is separated from their concrete network deployment or data format bindings.This allows the reuse of abstract definitions: messages, which are abstract descriptions of the data being exchanged, and port types which are abstract collections of operations. The concrete protocol and data format specifications for a particular port type constitutes a reusable binding. A port is defined by associating a network address with a reusable binding, and a collection of ports define a service. Hence, a WSDL document uses the following elements in the definition of network services: Types- a container for data type definitions using some type system (such as XSD). Message- an abstract, typed definition of the data being communicated. Operation- an abstract description of an action supported by the service. Port Type- an abstract set of operations supported by one or more endpoints.  Binding- a concrete protocol and data format specification for a particular port type.

Instead of having to write ad hoc translators for each pair of such systems, each system will only need to have a single translator for converting process descriptions in that system into and out of the common PIF format. Then any system will be able to automatically exchange basic process descriptions with any other system. The PIF project aims to support sharing process descriptions such a way that that they can be automatically translated back and forth between PIF and other process representations with as little loss of meaning as possible. If translation cannot be done fully automatically, the human efforts needed to assist the translation should be minimized. If a translator cannot translate part of a PIF process description to its target format, it will: Translate as much of the description as possible (and not, for example, simply issue an error message and give up); Represent any untranslatable parts so that the translator can add them back to the process description when it is translated back into PIF.', '', workspace}

An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization. Formally, an ontology is the statement of a logical theory. We use common ontologies to describe ontological commitments for a set of agents so that they can communicate about a domain of discourse without necessarily operating on a globally shared theory. We say that an agent commits to an ontology if its observable actions are consistent with the definitions in the ontology. The Knowledge Level is a level of description of the knowledge of an agent that is independent of the symbol-level representation used internally by the agent. Knowledge is attributed to agents by observing their actions; an agent "knows" something if it acts as if it had the information and is acting rationally to achieve its goals. The "actions" of agents (including knowledge base servers and knowledge-based systems) can be seen through a tell and ask functional interface, where a client interacts with an agent by making logical assertions (tell), and posing queries (ask). Pragmatically, a common ontology defines the vocabulary with which queries and assertions are exchanged among agents. Ontological commitments are agreements to use the shared vocabulary in a coherent and consistent manner. The agents sharing a vocabulary need not share a knowledge base; each knows things the other does not, and an agent that commits to an ontology is not required to answer all queries that can be formulated in the shared vocabulary.', 'MDA Standards for Ontology Development, http://afrodita.rcub.bg.ac.yu/~gasevic/tutorials/ICWE2004/', workspace}

In the chapters so far, SPEM has been directly defined as a meta-model. SPEM can be used by directly instantiating this stand-alone meta-model. But SPEM is also defined as a UML Profile. SPEM is dedicated to software processes modeling. Many features of the UML provide the necessary basis for modeling processes, and many other UML features provide useful additional modeling capacities. Being a UML profile, SPEM both defines modeling capacities dedicated to the software process domain, and gains the benefit of the expressiveness of UML. For example, Use Case modeling, which is sometimes used for modeling processes, is not defined as a specific SPEM facility, but can be inherited from UML. Alignment with various process modeling languages is another advantage of using UML Profiles. The SPEM profile uses extensively the UML Activity Diagram model to give more detail to the work decomposition that is represented in the stand-alone meta-model by the WorkDefinition::subWork association. It is expected that the various kinds of process modeling techniques (Business Process Modeling, Workflow, etc.) will be aligned with UML at some time.
